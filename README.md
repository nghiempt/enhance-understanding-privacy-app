# Unveiling Discrepancies in Android App Data Safety Declarations and Privacy Policies: An In-depth Analysis using Large Language Models

## Abstract

This paper delves into the critical discrepancies observed between data safety declarations and privacy policies across 450 Android applications, bringing to light the issues of incompleteness, incorrectness, and inconsistency. 
Such misalignments undermine user trust and pose severe ethical and legal challenges. 
Our research is a pioneering effort in this domain, posing crucial questions about the potential of technology to rectify these disparities. 
We postulate whether advanced techniques, precisely fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), could be leveraged to monitor and verify app behaviors against their declared commitments, ensuring unity and fortifying trust. 
In our investigation, we comprehensively assess the flexibility and capability of LLMs across multiple training scenarios, establishing ten evaluation cases within four distinct strategies, including Zero-Shot, Manual Label Fine-Tuning, and LLM-generated label fine-tuning. 
As a commitment to transparency and furthering research in this domain, we release a benchmark dataset and maintain a curated list of the examined Android applications. 
Our findings contribute significantly to understanding the alignment of privacy policies and data safety declarations, setting the stage for future informed, transparent, and trustworthy app ecosystems.


## Software implementation

> Briefly describe the software that was written to produce the results of this
> paper.

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `results`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

## Approach

We have somes way to collect data from browers. After, pre-proccessing data. This file below:

    approach/make_dataset/make_final_dataset_only_prompt.py
    approach/make_dataset/make_resource_dataset.py

## Evaluation

![alt text](https://github.com/nghiempt/enhance-understanding-privacy-app/blob/main/evaluation.png?raw=true)

We have 10 cases. We use LLM models to generate result:

    evaluation/case_03/code/generate_completion_by_gpt3.0.py

As same as for cases 4,5,6,7,8,9,10


We convert chat json format to message json format in:

    helpers/convert_message_for_3.5.py

After that, we continue to convert to JSONL in:

    helpers/convert_json_to_jsonl.py

Follow for this step to fine tuning GPT 3.5 turbo:

1.Upload files

    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
        -F "purpose=fine-tune" \
        -F "file=@path_to_your_file"

2.Create a fine-tuning job

    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
        -d '{
        "training_file": "TRAINING_FILE_ID",
        "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"
        }'

We can use terminal to follow fine tuning process:

    pip install --upgrade openai

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

    openai api fine_tuning.job.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>

or

    openai api fine_tuning.job.get -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>

You can check status for this proccess: validating-file -> running -> succeed

Finally, we use the model after fine tuned to predict result:
