The Data Safety mentions sharing of Device or other IDs, and the Privacy Policy explains the various ways data is shared, which aligns with the concept of Device or other IDs.

        "completion": "Based on the information presented, here is the analysis:\n\nIncomplete: 0 - The Data Safety section appears to provide the same categories/types of data being shared as the Privacy Policy, without any glaring omissions.\n\nIncorrect: 1 - The Data Safety section only mentions a single recipient for sharing data (the app), whereas the Privacy Policy expands this to include explicit consent/authorization, public/judicial/police authorities, and other scenarios. This could be seen as incorrect as it doesn't correctly represent the various ways data can be shared.\n\nInconsistency: 1 - The Data Safety section states that it shares approximate location, user IDs, app interactions, crash logs, diagnostics, other app performance data, and device IDs. However, the Privacy Policy states that data would only be shared in scenarios stipulated in the policy (or with explicit consent/authorization) and may be transferred in case of corporate transactions. These scenarios are not explicitly addressed in the Data Safety section, leading to inconsistency.",
